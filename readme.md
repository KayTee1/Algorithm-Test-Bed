# Search and Sorting Algorithms Test Bed

## Overview

This project provides a test bed for various search and sorting algorithms implemented in C++. You can use this test bed to run and measure the performance of different algorithms for searching and sorting data.

## Algorithms Included

- **Sequential Search (`sequentialSearch.cpp`):**
  - Performs a linear search to find an element in a list.
  - Measures the time taken to search for a key in a list.
  - Reports the results.

- **Binary Search (`binarySearch.cpp`):**
  - Performs a binary search to find an element in a sorted list.
  - Measures the time taken to search for a key in a list.
  - Reports the results, including the number of comparisons.

- **Insertion Sort (`insertionSort.cpp`):**
  - Implements the insertion sort sorting technique.
  - Measures the time taken to sort a list.
  - Reports the results.

- **Quick Sort (`quickSort.cpp`):**
  - Implements the quick sort sorting technique.
  - Measures the time taken to sort a list.
  - Reports the results.
